Sankey diagrams provide a visual depiction of the magnitude of flow between nodes in a network. Bar charts display data for a discrete variable (e.g., category, event, timepoint). Combining Sankey diagrams with bar charts allows users to track the path of data throughout multiple steps or stages of a system.
