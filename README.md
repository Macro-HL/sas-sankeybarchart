A quick overview of the macro is available at the [wiki](https://github.com/RhoInc/sas-sankeybarchart/wiki).

This macro was originally published as part of a PharmaSUG 2015 paper by Shane Rosanbalm titled [Getting Sankey with Bar Charts](http://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2015/DV/PharmaSUG-2015-DV07.pdf). At the SESUG 2016 conference Yichen Zhong presented a follow-up paper titled [Sankey Diagram with Incomplete Data â€“ From a Medical Research Perspective](http://www.lexjansen.com/sesug/2016/LS-142_Final_PDF.pdf). In this second paper several enhancements to the original macro are suggested. Many of these updates were incorporated into [version 2.0](https://github.com/RhoInc/sas-sankeybarchart/wiki/Version-2.0) of the macro. Many thanks to Yichen for the valuable suggestions.
